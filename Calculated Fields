TABLEAU STEPS FOR VIZ

Calculated Fields:

(a)	For 1st Sheet (Total Profit)

1.	CurrentYearIndicator	Year([Order Date]) = {FIXED:max(Year([Order Date]))}
2.	PriorYearIndicator		Year([Order Date]) = {FIXED:max(Year([Order Date]))}-1
3.	Profit-CY			        ifnull(if[CurrentYearIndicator] then [Profit] END,0)
4.	Profit-PY		        	ifnull(if [PriorYearIndicator] then [Profit] END,0)
5.	Profit Change	    		SUM([Profit-CY])- SUM([Profit-PY])
6.	Profit Change%	    	(SUM([Profit-CY])-SUM([Profit-PY]))/SUM([Profit-PY])

CurrentYearIndicator: This calculated field uses the FIXED function to identify the maximum year in the 'Order Date' field. It then checks if the 'Order Date' year matches the maximum year.
PriorYearIndicator: This calculated field subtracts one from the maximum year identified in the 'CurrentYearIndicator' to return the prior year. It then checks if the 'Order Date' year matches the prior year.
Profit-CY: This calculates the profit for the current year (CY) by checking the 'CurrentYearIndicator' and returning the 'Profit' value if true. Otherwise, it returns 0.
Profit-PY: This calculates the profit for the prior year (PY) by checking the 'PriorYearIndicator' and returning the 'Profit' value if true. Otherwise, it returns 0.
Profit Change: This subtracts the total profit for PY from the total profit for CY.
Profit Change%: This calculates the percentage change in profit between CY and PY by dividing the profit change by the total profit for PY.


(b)	For 2nd Sheet (Total Orders)

1.	Order-PY			      ifnull(if [PriorYearIndicator] then [Order ID] END,'0')
2.	Order-CY			      ifnull(if[CurrentYearIndicator] then [Order ID] END,'0')
3.	Order Change	    	(COUNT([Order-CY])- COUNT([Order-PY ]))
4.	Order Change%		    (COUNTD([Order-CY])-COUNTD([Order-PY ]))/COUNTD([Order-PY ])

Order-PY: This calculates the order ID for the prior year (PY) by checking the 'PriorYearIndicator' and returning the 'Order ID' value if true. Otherwise, it returns '0'.
Order-CY: This calculates the order ID for the current year (CY) by checking the 'CurrentYearIndicator' and returning the 'Order ID' value if true. Otherwise, it returns '0'.
Order Change: This subtracts the total number of orders in PY from the total number of orders in CY.
Order Change%: This calculates the percentage change in orders between CY and PY by dividing the number of order changes by the total number of orders in PY.


(c)	For 3rd Sheet (Turnover)

1.	Sales-CY			    ifnull(if[CurrentYearIndicator] then [Sales] END,0)
2.	Profit Ratio	  	SUM([Profit-CY])/SUM([Sales-CY])
3.	Sales-PY			    ifnull(if[PriorYearIndicator] then [Sales] END,0)

Sales-CY: This calculates the sales for the current year (CY) by checking the 'CurrentYearIndicator' and returning the 'Sales' value if true. Otherwise, it returns 0.
Profit Ratio: This divides the total profit for CY by the total sales for CY to arrive at the profit ratio.
Sales-PY: This calculates the sales for the prior year (PY) by checking the 'PriorYearIndicator' and returning the 'Sales' value if true. Otherwise, it returns 0.


(d)	For Total Sales

1.	Sales-Change%		(SUM([Sales-CY])-SUM([Sales-PY]))/SUM([Sales-PY])

Sales-Change%: This calculates the percentage change in sales between CY and PY by dividing the difference in total sales between CY and PY by the total sales for PY.
